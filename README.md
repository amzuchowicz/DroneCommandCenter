#Drone Command Center

This is my thesis project for 2016.

There are three methods by which you can control an AR.Drone 2.0: 
-Emotiv Insight BCI
-Gestures
-Voice
 
Make sure location and bluetooth is enabled for the Insight. Use the official apps to determine if your device is compatible. 
Close all other apps like FreeFlight and Insight!
Make sure you connect to the AR.Drone 2.0 and Insight before launching the app.
100% compatible with the Nexus 5. 
 
This app was not designed to be user friendly for the public. It was made for the purposes of evaluating the efficiency and effectiveness of the studied control modalities. Feel free to try out the app. If you have any issues or questions, please contact me.
